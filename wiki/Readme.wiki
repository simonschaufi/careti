== How to use Careti ==

  * Install as a Greasemonkey script to apply to all textarea elements across the whole web.
  * Integrate into your own web application

== Quirks & usage notes ==

  * It will work on <input> elements but has scrolling issues if there is more text in the box than can be shown.
  * You really don't want it on all <input> elements (think login names)
  * No IE support yet. Not a priority. If you want it, send me the code.
